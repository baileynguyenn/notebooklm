Summary of "Blockchain technology in supply chain operations: Applications, challenges and research opportunities"
This article reviews 178 research articles exploring the applications, challenges, and research opportunities of blockchain technology in supply chain management.
What is Blockchain?
Blockchain is a decentralised and distributed ledger technology (DLT). It provides a secure and transparent way to record and track transactions, making it ideal for managing complex supply chains.
Key Features of Blockchain
●
Decentralised structure: Data is distributed across a network of computers rather than a central authority.
●
Distributed nodes and storage mechanism: All participants in the network have a copy of the ledger, ensuring data redundancy and security.
●
Consensus algorithm: Transactions are validated and added to the blockchain through a consensus mechanism, ensuring data integrity and trust.
●
Smart contracting: Self-executing contracts can be programmed onto the blockchain, automating processes and reducing the need for intermediaries.
●
Asymmetric encryption: Ensures network security by using cryptographic keys to protect data and transactions.
Benefits of Blockchain in Supply Chain Operations
Blockchain technology offers numerous potential benefits for supply chain operations, including:
●
Enhanced Transparency and Traceability: Blockchain enables real-time tracking of goods and transactions throughout the supply chain, improving visibility and accountability.
●
Improved Security and Trust: The decentralised and immutable nature of blockchain enhances data security and reduces the risk of fraud and counterfeiting.
●
Increased Efficiency and Reduced Costs: Automating processes through smart contracts and streamlining transactions can lead to increased efficiency and cost savings.
●
Enhanced Data Management: Blockchain provides a secure and reliable platform for managing and sharing data among supply chain partners.
●
Strengthened Supply Chain Resilience: Blockchain can help mitigate risks associated with disruptions and improve the resilience of supply chains.
