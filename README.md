# NotebookLM Demonstrations

This repository contains practical demonstrations and evaluations of **Google's NotebookLM** features for educational use in a university setting. NotebookLM leverages advanced language models to enhance learning by providing context-driven insights based on user-provided content. Each folder in this repository includes examples, experiment results, and assessments of specific NotebookLM functionalities.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by individual NotebookLM features, with each feature demonstrated in a separate folder. Each folder contains the document used, the query or task requested, and the result generated by NotebookLM. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the main features demonstrated:

### 1. Content-Driven Question Answering
   - **Description**: Demonstrates NotebookLM's ability to provide answers directly from uploaded documents.
   - **Example**: Uploads a research paper and queries specific information, with NotebookLM responding based on the content.

### 2. Summarization of Complex Texts
   - **Description**: Shows how NotebookLM can condense dense academic texts into concise summaries.
   - **Example**: Uploads a research article, and NotebookLM generates a summary, capturing the main points and supporting efficient learning.

### 3. Contextual Insights and Explanations
   - **Description**: Evaluates NotebookLM's ability to clarify unfamiliar terms and concepts within academic documents.
   - **Example**: Uploads a complex paper and queries specific terms, with NotebookLM providing contextual explanations to enhance understanding.

### 4. Generation of Study Guides and Summaries
   - **Description**: Demonstrates how NotebookLM can create custom study guides from uploaded materials.
   - **Example**: Uploads a textbook, and NotebookLM produces a study guide or outline to aid in exam preparation.

## Getting Started

To explore the examples and experiment results:

1. **Navigate** to the relevant folder for each NotebookLM functionality.
2. **Open the `experiment1.md`** file to see the setup, query, and response generated by NotebookLM.
3. **Review the `output1.txt`** files to analyze NotebookLM's outputs and see a comparison with manually summarized or queried content.

## How to Use NotebookLM

NotebookLM is an experimental product by Google and is accessible at [notebooklm.google](https://notebooklm.google/). This tool allows users to upload documents and interact with the content through language model-driven insights. It is particularly useful for students, researchers, and educators looking to enhance their understanding of academic texts through interactive summaries, explanations, and study guides.

## Objectives of This Repository

- **Evaluate** the practical use of NotebookLM's features in an educational context.
- **Document** the effectiveness of each feature in responding to specific academic tasks.
- **Provide feedback** for improvements and potential uses in a university setting.
