Study Guide: New Challenges for Macroeconomic Policies
Introduction
●
The Focus of Macroeconomics is Shifting: The book argues that macroeconomics is shifting its focus from short-term concerns like business cycles and inflation to long-term structural changes. These changes include factors like:
○
Demography
○
Savings trends
○
Financial cycles
○
Wealth distribution
○
Innovation systems
●
New Challenges Demand New Approaches: The book explores how these structural changes are impacting traditional macroeconomic theories and policies, leading to the emergence of new doctrines and analytical frameworks.
●
The Book's Scope and Audience: The book focuses primarily on industrialized countries and aims to provide insights for:
○
Macroeconomists (academic and professional)
○
Policymakers in central banks, governments, and international organizations
○
Students of macroeconomics and economic policy
○
Anyone interested in sustainable growth, inequality, and ecological transition

●
Chapter 2: Production Capacity in Advanced Economies
○
Focus: This chapter examines recent trends in the production capacity of advanced economies, considering factors like digital technology, labor markets, and global financial systems.
○
Key Questions:
■
How is the concept of "advanced economies" evolving beyond traditional industrialization?
■
What is the impact of digital technology on material investments and resource extraction?
■
How do demographic dynamics and changes in labor markets affect production capacity?
■
Theoretical Frameworks: The chapter reviews different approaches to modeling the impact of technological change on growth:
●
Neoclassical Endogenous Growth Models: Focus on the role of ICT, robotics, and artificial intelligence in production functions.
●
Schumpeterian Models: Emphasize the role of innovation, creative destruction, and long waves in economic development.
●

○
Implications for Macroeconomic Teaching: The chapter suggests revising how the aggregate supply function is taught, taking into account:
